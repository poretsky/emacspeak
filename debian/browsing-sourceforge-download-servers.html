<p>Sourceforge is a nice service, but it can also be painful to
use because of the heavy-weight Web page design, and the need to
repeatedly click before you get the download you want.</p>
<p>The most irksome of these is the download mechanism provided
by Sourceforge --- where you first need to browse a list of
download servers, pick a mirror, and then download what you
want. 
Emacspeak implements a <em>Smart URL</em> that enables one to
download from Sourceforge in a single step.</p>
<p>By default, this uses a North American mirror; the behavior
can be customized if outside the US.
Use <em>smart URL</em> <code>Sourceforge Browse Mirror</code> and
specify the name of a SF hosted project when prompted.
This brings up the index page for the project's download area,
sorted by date. Move to the bottom of the page and   hit
<code>b</code> to move to the latest available download.</p>
<p>The <em>smart URL</em> sets up the W3 buffer with a
context-sensitive download function; when on a download link, hit
<code>C-d</code>
to start downloading. This command will prompt for the URL;
rather than hitting <code>return</code> (which would bring you to
the <em>browse mirrors</em> page, hit <code>M-p</code> to get the
download URL for your  SF mirror.
Note that this wizard uses <code>GNU wget</code> to perform the
download
via Emacs module <code>w3-wget</code>.</p>
