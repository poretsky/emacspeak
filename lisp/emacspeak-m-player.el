;;; Defines a simple derived mode for interacting with mplayer.
;;; mplayer  is a versatile media player capable of playing many
;;; streaming formats  and is especially useful for playing windows
;;; media (WMA) and streaming windows media (ASF) files.
;;;mplayer is available  on the WWW:
;;; RPM package
;;;http://mirrors.sctpc.com/dominik/linux/pkgs/mplayer/i586/mplayer-0.90pre5-2.i586.rpm
;;;You may need the  win32 codecs which can be downloaded from
