;;{{{ Introduction:

;;; Commentary:

;;; This module defines the advice forms for making the core of Emacs speak
;;; Advice forms that are specific to Emacs subsystems do not belong here!
;;; I violate this at present by advising completion comint and
;;; shell here.

;;; Note that we needed to advice a lot more for Emacs 19 and
;;;Emacs 20 than we do for Emacs 21 and Emacs 22.
;;; As of August 2007, this file is being purged of advice forms
;;;not needed in Emacs 22.
;;; This also means that this and subsequent versions of
;;;Emacspeak should not be run on versions of Emacs older than
;;;Emacs 21,
;;; And preferably only run on Emacs 22.
;;; This version of Emacspeak is only tested on Emacs 24 and later.
