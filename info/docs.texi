@node acss-structure
@section acss-structure

The CSS Speech Style Sheet specification defines a number of
abstract device independent voice properties.
A setting conforming to the CSS speech specification can be
represented in elisp as a structure.

We will refer to this structure as a "speech style".
This structure needs to be mapped to device dependent codes to
produce the desired effect.
This module forms a bridge between User Agents e.g. Emacs-w3 that
wish to implement a speech style sheet
and Emacspeak's dectalk-voices module.
Emacspeak produces voice change effects by examining the value of
text-property 'personality.

Think of a buffer of formatted text along with the text-property
'personality appropriately set as a "aural display list".
Applications like W3 that produce such formatted buffers  call function
acss-personality-from-speech-style  with a  "speech-style"
--a structure as defined in this module and get back a symbol that
they then assign to the value of property 'personality.
Emacspeak's rendering engine then does the needful at the time
speech is produced.
Function acss-personality-from-speech-style does the following:
Takes as input a "speech style"
(1)  Computes a symbol that will be used henceforth to refer to this
specific speech style.
(2) Examines emacspeak's internal voice table to see if this
speech style has a voice already defined.
If so it returns immediately.
Otherwise, it does the additional work of defining a dectalk-voice for
future use.
See module dectalk-voices.el to see how voices are defined.

CONGRATS ==  Convert Graphics To Sound
I first implemented this idea in late   1988 for my final year project at IIT Bombay.
A scaled-down version of this project was submitted to the John Hopkins  National Search  in 1991
See  @url{http://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/raman/publications/ieee-congrats.ps}
Congrats was originally implemented on a BBC Micro with 32K of memory.
This module provides data sonification services for the Emacspeak Audio Desktop
in the spirit of Congrats --- it uses package siggen --- and specifically, the tones utility from that package for generating the auditory output.
Note that  the original version of CONGRATS  enabled  multiple types of "scans"
you could listen to a curve in terms of Cartesian or Polar coordinates.

@node dectalk-voices
@section dectalk-voices

This module defines the various voices used in voice-lock mode.
This module is Dectalk specific.

@subsection dectalk-voices Commands

@subsubsection dectalk
@deffn {Command} dectalk   
@kbd{C-e d C-d}

@kindex C-e d C-d
@findex dectalk

@end format
@end deffn

@node dom
@section dom

@node dom-addons
@section dom-addons

Useful additional functions for dom.el

@node dtk-interp
@section dtk-interp

All requests to the speech server are factored out into
this module.
These calls are declared here as defsubst so they are
inlined by the byte compiler.
This  keeps the code efficient,
but gives us the flexibility to call out to different
speech servers.

@node dtk-speak
@section dtk-speak

Defines the TTS interface.

@subsection dtk-speak Commands

@subsubsection dtk-add-cleanup-pattern
@deffn {Command} dtk-add-cleanup-pattern  (&optional delete)

@findex dtk-add-cleanup-pattern

@format
Add this pattern to the list of repeating patterns that
are cleaned up.  Optional interactive prefix arg deletes
this pattern if previously added.  Cleaning up repeated
patterns results in emacspeak speaking the pattern followed
by a repeat count instead of speaking all the characters
making up the pattern.  Thus, by adding the repeating
pattern ``.'' (this is already added by default) emacspeak
will say ````aw fifteen dot'''' when speaking the string
````...............'''' instead of ````period period period period

@kbd{C-e d SPC}

@kindex C-e d SPC
@findex dtk-toggle-splitting-on-white-space

@format
Toggle splitting of speech on white space.
This affects the internal state of emacspeak that decides if we split
text purely by clause boundaries, or also include
whitespace.  By default, emacspeak sends a clause at a time
to the speech device.  This produces fluent speech for
normal use.  However in modes such as ``shell-mode'' and some
programming language modes, clause markers appear
infrequently, and this can result in large amounts of text
being sent to the speech device at once, making the system
unresponsive when asked to stop talking.  Splitting on white
space makes emacspeak''s stop command responsive.  However,
when splitting on white space, the speech sounds choppy
since the synthesizer is getting a word at a time.

@section emacspeak

Emacspeak extends Emacs to be a fully functional audio desktop.
This is the main emacspeak module.
It actually does very little:
It sets up Emacs to load package-specific Emacspeak modules as each package is loaded.
It implements function emacspeak which loads the rest of the system.

@subsection emacspeak Commands

@subsubsection emacspeak
@deffn {Command} emacspeak   
@findex emacspeak

@format
Starts the Emacspeak  Audio Desktop.  Use emacs as you
normally would, emacspeak will provide you spoken feedback
as you work.  Emacspeak also provides commands for having
parts of the current buffer, the mode-line etc to be spoken.

If you are hearing this description as a result of pressing
C-h C-e you may want to press
C-e s to stop speech, and then use the arrow keys to
move around in the Help buffer to read the rest of this
description, which includes a summary of all emacspeak
keybindings.

All emacspeak commands use C-e as a
prefix key.  You can also set the state of the TTS engine  by
using C-e d as a prefix.  Here is
a summary of all emacspeak commands along with their
bindings.  You need to precede the keystrokes listed below
with C-e.

Emacspeak also provides a fluent speech extension to the
emacs terminal emulator (eterm).  Note: You need to use the
term package that comes with emacs-19.29 and later.

@node emacspeak-advice
@section emacspeak-advice

This module defines the advice forms for making the core of Emacs speak
Advice forms that are specific to Emacs subsystems do not belong here!
I violate this at present by advising completion comint and
shell here.

Note that we needed to advice a lot more for Emacs 19 and
Emacs 20 than we do for Emacs 21 and Emacs 22.
As of August 2007, this file is being purged of advice forms
not needed in Emacs 22.
This also means that this and subsequent versions of
Emacspeak should not be run on versions of Emacs older than
Emacs 21,
And preferably only run on Emacs 22.
This version of Emacspeak is only tested on Emacs 24 and later.

BBC: http://www.bbc.co.uk
This module uses
publicly available REST APIs to implement a native Emacs
client for browsing and listening to BBC programs.

See http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/developers
The BBC API helps locate a PID for a given program stream.
We then construct the BBC IPlayer URL for that  PID,
And either hand that link off to Chrome,
Or stream it via get_iplayer and mplayer.
get_iplayer: https://github.com/get-iplayer/get_iplayer.git
get_player vs Chrome: Pro/Con:
Chrome: Has the UI for seeking in the stream.
get_iplayer: We use a named pipe, and cannot seek,
but the rest of emacspeak-m-player is available.
For downloading a program etc., use Emacs package iplayer.

Emacspeak is better than a traditional screenreader. This module
was originally written to interface to the old ediff.el bundled
with GNU Emacs 19.28 and earlier. It has been updated to work
with the newer and much larger ediff system found in Emacs 19.29
and later.

In celebration of a million books and more to read from
Google Books
The EPubs format is slightly simpler than full Daisy ---
(see) emacspeak-daisy.el
Since it only needs one level of indirection (no audio,
therefore no smil). This module is consequently simpler than
emacspeak-daisy.el.
This module will eventually  implement the Google Books  API
--- probably by invoking the yet-to-be-written gbooks.el in emacs-g-client
As we move to epub-3, this module will bring back audio layers etc., perhaps via a simplified smil implementation.

It is often useful  to view the results of filtering
large amounts of text.;;; Typically you do this with
various combinations of grep and friends.
When doing so it requires explicit effort to not destroy
the original text being filtered.
This module provides a textfilter utility that:
A) Copies over the selected text to a special filtertext
buffer
B) Implements a filtertext mode for that buffer that
allows easy application of filters
C: Provides commands for reverting to the original
unfiltered text
D: Provides commands for saving results from
intermediate filters.

@node emacspeak-gridtext
@section emacspeak-gridtext

Emacspeak's table browsing mode allows one to
efficiently access  content that is tabular in nature.
That module also provides functions for inferring table
structure where possible.
Often, such structure is hard to infer automatically
--but might be known to the user 
e.g. treat columns 1 through 30 as one column of a table
and so on.
This module allows the user to specify a conceptual grid
that is "overlaid" on the region of text to turn it into
a table for tabular browsing. For now, elements of the
grid are "one line" high --but that may change in the
future if necessary. This module is useful for browsing
structured text files and the output from programs that
tabulate their output.
It's also useful for handling multicolumn text.

MUGGLES ==  Keybinding Conveniences For The Emacspeak Desktop.

This module implements no new functionality --- contrast with
emacspeak-wizards.  Instead, it uses package hydra to provide
convenience key-bindings that access existing Emacspeak
functionality.
This module is automatically loaded if package Hydra is loaded.
You need to install package Hydra first:
@samp{M-x package-install  hydra}.

Note that on newer versions of Emacs, loading this module will
attempt to automatically install package hydra if it is not found.

@subsection Implemented Muggles

@itemize
@item Brightness: <print> Control display brightness using xbacklight.
@item View-Mode: <C-c v> Temporarily behave like view-mode.
@item Navigate: <s-n> Navigate with ease.
@item  org-mode structure nav: <C-c SPC> Structure navigation  for org-mode.
@item  org-mode tables: <C-c t> Table UI for org-mode tables.
@item m-player: <s-m> Emacspeak-M-Player Commands
@item hideshow: C-c h Provide HideShow bindings.
@item toggle-option:  <C-c o> Single binding for toggling options.
@item outliner: <C-c .> Bindings from outline-minor-mode.
@item Info-Summary: <?> in Info Info Summary Muggle
@end itemize

Emacspeak automatically speaks Hydra hints when displayed.
To silence all Hydra hints, set hydra-is-helpful to nil.  To
temporarily silence speaking of Hydra hints, Muggles can bind
command @code{emacspeak-muggles-toggle-talkative}.  As an
example, Muggle @samp{ViewMode} binds @code{s} to this command.

This module assumes that sane is installed and working
for image acquisition,
and that there is an OCR engine that can take acquired
images and produce text.
Prerequisites:
Sane installed and working.
scanimage to generate tiff files from scanner.
tiffcp to compress the tiff file.
working ocr executable 
by default this module assumes that the OCR executable
is named "ocr"

@subsection emacspeak-ocr Commands

@subsubsection emacspeak-ocr
@deffn {Command} emacspeak-ocr   
@kbd{C-e C-o}

@kindex C-e C-o
@findex emacspeak-ocr

@format
An OCR front-end for the Emacspeak desktop.  

Page image is acquired using tools from the SANE package.
The acquired image is run through the OCR engine if one is
available, and the results placed in a buffer that is
suitable for browsing the results.

For detailed help, invoke command emacspeak-ocr bound to
C-e C-o to launch emacspeak-ocr-mode, and press
``?'' to display mode-specific help for emacspeak-ocr-mode.

@format
Run OCR engine on current image after flip-flopping it.
Useful if you''ve scanned a page upside down and are using an engine that does not automatically flip the image for you.
You need the imagemagik family of tools --- we use mogrify to transform the image.
Prompts for image file if file corresponding to the expected
``current page'' is not found.

@end deffn

@subsubsection emacspeak-ocr-forward-page
@deffn {Command} emacspeak-ocr-forward-page  (&optional count-ignored)
@findex emacspeak-ocr-forward-page

@subsubsection emacspeak-ocr-mode
@deffn {Command} emacspeak-ocr-mode   
@findex emacspeak-ocr-mode

@format
 An OCR front-end for the Emacspeak desktop.

Pre-requisites:

1) A working scanner back-end like SANE on Linux.

2) An OCR engine.

1: Make sure your scanner back-end works, and that you have
the utilities to scan a document and acquire an image as a
tiff file.  Then set variable
emacspeak-ocr-scan-image-program to point at this utility.
By default, this is set to ``scanimage'' which is the image
scanning utility provided by SANE.

By default, this front-end attempts to compress the acquired
tiff image; make sure you have a utility like tiffcp.
Variable emacspeak-ocr-compress-image is set to ``tiffcp'' by
default; if you use something else, you should customize
this variable.

2: Next, make sure you have an OCR engine installed and
working.  By default this front-end assumes that OCR is
available as /usr/bin/ocr.

Once you have ensured that acquiring an image and applying
OCR to it work independently of Emacs, you can use this
Emacspeak front-end to enable easy OCR access from within
Emacspeak.

The Emacspeak OCR front-end is launched by command
emacspeak-ocr bound to C-e C-o.  

This command switches to a special buffer that has OCR
commands bounds to single keystrokes-- see the key-binding
list at the end of this description.  Use Emacs online help
facility to look up help on these commands.

emacspeak-ocr-mode provides the necessary functionality to
scan, OCR, read and save documents.  By default, scanned
images and the resulting text are saved under directory
~/ocr; see variable emacspeak-ocr-working-directory.
Invoking command emacspeak-ocr-open-working-directory bound
to M-x emacspeak-ocr-open-working-directory will open this directory.

By default, the document being scanned is named ``untitled''.
You can name the document by using command
emacspeak-ocr-name-document bound to
M-x emacspeak-ocr-name-document.  The document name is used
in constructing the name of the image and text files.

Implementation Notes From 2015:

Setting emacspeak-personality-voiceify-faces to nil (none via
customize interface) now results in dtk-speak falling back to the
face->voice mapping defined via voice-setup for the face at
point. What this means:

1. You always get voice-locking except
when you set voice-lock-mode to nil.

2. The advice on
put-text-property and friends become a no-op and we still get
voice-locking.

3. Eventually this will become the default behavior
for voice-locking.

Implementation Notes from 2002.

This module defines a personality interface for implementing voice
lock via font lock.

@subsection emacspeak-personality Options

@defvar {User Option} emacspeak-personality-voiceify-faces
Determines how and if we voiceify faces.

All means   faces are  mapped directly to voices -- this is the default

Prepend means that the corresponding personality is prepended to the
existing personalities on the text.

Append means place corresponding personality at the end.

Simple means that voiceification is not cumulative.

@end defvar

@defvar {User Option} emacspeak-personality-voiceify-overlays
Determines how and if we voiceify overlays.

None means that overlay faces are not mapped to voices.
Prepend means that the corresponding personality is prepended to the
existing personalities on the text under overlay.

Append means place corresponding personality at the end.

@subsection PIANOBAR ==  Pandora Client for Emacs

pianobar git://github.com/PromyLOPh/pianobar.git Ubuntu/Debian:
sudo apt-get install pianobar 

Pianobar Is a stand-alone client for Pandora Radio. pianobar.el
available on the Emacs Wiki at
http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/pianobar.el Provides access to
Pandora Radio via pianobar from the comfort of Emacs. This module
speech-enables Pianobar and enhances it for the Complete Audio
Desktop.

@subsection Emacspeak Usage:

Emacspeak implements command emacspeak-pianobar, a light-weight
wrapper on top of pianobar. Emacspeak binds this command to
@code{C-e '}. In my personal @code{.emacs}, I bind this to
@code{f5}. Command emacspeak-pianobar is designed to let you
launch Pandora channels and switch tracks/channels without moving
away from your primary tasks such as editting code or
reading/composing email. Toward this end, launching command
emacspeak-pianobar the first time initializes the
@code{*pianobar*} buffer and launches command @code{pianobar};
Focus is placed in the @code{*pianobar*} buffer. Pianobar can be
controlled with single keystrokes while in this buffer. The most
useful keys are @code{right} for skipping tracks, @code{up} and
@code{down} for switching channels etc.; see the keys bound in
@code{pianobar-key-map} for a complete list. Pressing @code{C-e '}
in  the @code{*pianobar*} buffer  buries the
@code{*pianobar*}. From here on, Pianobar can be controlled
by pressing the Pianobar prefix key (@code{C-e '}) followed by
keys from @code{pianobar-key-map}.

@section emacspeak-pronounce

This module implements user customizable pronunciation dictionaries
for emacspeak. Custom pronunciations can be defined per file, per
directory and/or per major mode. Emacspeak maintains a persistent
user dictionary upon request and loads these in new emacspeak
sessions. This module implements the user interface to the custom
dictionary as well as providing the internal API used by the rest
of emacspeak in using the dictionary.
Algorithm:

The persistent dictionary is a hash table where the hash keys are
filenames, directory names, or major-mode names. The hash values
are association lists defining the dictionary. Users of this module
can retrieve a dictionary made up of all applicable association
lists for a given file.

@node emacspeak-sounds
@section emacspeak-sounds

This module provides the interface for generating auditory icons in emacspeak.
Design goal:
1) Auditory icons should be used to provide additional feedback,
not as a gimmick.
2) The interface should be usable at all times without the icons:
e.g. when on a machine without a sound card.
3) General principle for when to use an icon:
Convey information about events taking place in parallel.
For instance, if making a selection automatically moves the current focus
to the next choice,
We speak the next choice, while indicating the fact that something was selected with a sound cue.
 This interface will assume the availability of a shell command "play"
that can take one or more sound files and play them.
This module will also provide a mapping between names in the elisp world and actual sound files.
Modules that wish to use auditory icons should use these names, instead of actual file names.
As of Emacspeak 13.0, this module defines a themes
architecture for  auditory icons.
Sound files corresponding to a given theme are found in
appropriate subdirectories of emacspeak-sounds-directory

@node soundscape
@section soundscape

Soundscapes @url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soundscape}
define an acoustic environment.
Boodler  at @url{http://boodler.org} is a
Python-based SoundScape generator.
To use this module, first install boodler.
Then install the soundscape packages (*.boop) files available
at @url{http://boodler.org/lib}.
Make sure boodler works and produces audio in your environment.
finally install the Boodler packages  from
emacspeak/scapes from the Emacspeak GitHub repository by running
@code{cd emacspeak/scapes; make }

When  boodler is set up and all packages installed, copy
file emacspeak/scapes/soundscapes  to ~/.boodler/Collection.
The above file lists all installed SoundScapes.
Directory emacspeak/scapes also contains
additional Boodler Agents and SoundScapes  that
I have created for use with Emacspeak.

 Module soundscape.el  defines Emacs conveniences for running
Soundscapes. Main Entry Points:

@itemize
@item M-x soundscape-toggle -- Enables or
disables automatic SoundScapes.
@item M-x soundscape --
runs a named SoundScape
@item M-x soundscape-stop -- Stops a specified running Soundscape.
@item M-x soundscape-kill -- Kills all running Soundscapes.
@end itemize

When automatic Soundscapes are enabled, SoundScapes are
 started and stopped based on the current major
mode. Active Soundscape  are displayed as part of the minor-mode-alist.
Command emacspeak-speak-minor-mode-line can be used to have this spoken.

Thus, SoundScapes can be thought of as reflecting the
@emph{mood} of the current @emph{mode}.
This package defines a single @var{soundscape-default-theme}
that is loaded using @code{(soundscape-load soundscape-default-theme)}.
Emacs modes that provide similar functionality e.g.,
communication == email, IM, ... map to  the same @emph{mood}.

support to sox, do

sudo apt-get libsox-fmt-mp3 install

This module provides support for ladspa effects using module ladspa.el.
To use ladspa effects with SoX, you need a relatively new build of Sox;

@node voice-setup
@section voice-setup

A voice is to audio as a font is to a visual display.
A personality is to audio as a face is to a visual display.

Voice-lock-mode is a minor mode that causes your comments to be
spoken in one personality, strings in another, reserved words in another,
documentation strings in another, and so on.

Comments will be spoken in `emacspeak-voice-lock-comment-personality'.
Strings will be spoken in `emacspeak-voice-lock-string-personality'.
Function and variable names (in their defining forms) will be
 spoken in `emacspeak-voice-lock-function-name-personality'.
Reserved words will be spoken in `emacspeak-voice-lock-keyword-personality'.

To make the text you type be voiceified, use M-x voice-lock-mode.
When this minor mode is on, the voices of the current line are
updated with every insertion or deletion.

How faces map to voices: TTS engine specific modules e.g.,
dectalk-voices.el and outloud-voices.el define a standard set
of voice names.  This module maps standard "personality"
names to these pre-defined voices.  It does this via special
form def-voice-font which takes a personality name, a voice
name and a face name to set up the mapping between face and
personality, and personality and voice.
Newer Emacspeak modules should use voice-setup-add-map when
defining face->personality mappings.
Older code calls def-voice-font directly, but over time those
calls will be changed to the more succinct form provided by
voice-setup-add-map. For use from other modules, also see
function voice-setup-map-face which is useful when mapping a
single face.
Both voice-setup-add-map and voice-setup-map-face call
special form def-voice-font.

Special form def-voice-font sets up the personality name to
be available via custom.  new voices can be defined using CSS
style specifications see special form defvoice Voices defined
via defvoice can be customized via custom see the
documentation for defvoice.

then the original face->personality mapping is restored.  In
either case, the buffer is refontified to have the new mapping
take effect.
